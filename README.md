# proj-bot

A Python script to speed up my workflow. As a designer, I don't want to be wasting time setting up directories.

The solution: Proj-Bot.

Here's how it works:

*  Upon running the script, you'll be prompted for a project name. 
*  It will create that folder preceeded by the current date. 
*  Then it creates directories within that folder.
*  Proj-Bot will ask if you want to copy in email templates. If so, which brand/abbreviation. It will copy them into a specific folder.
*  A third prompt will ask if you'd like Photoshop assets imported as well.
*  Last but certainly not least, it will ask if you'd like to setup anotoher project.

A very handy script for when a ton of production work comes your way.
