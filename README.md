# Proj-Bot

A Python script to speed up my workflow. As a designer, I don't want to be wasting time setting up directories.

The solution: Proj-Bot.

Here's how it works:

*  Upon running the script, you'll be prompted for a project name. 
*  It will create that folder preceeded by the current date. 
*  Then it creates directories within that project folder.
*  A prompt will ask if you'd like Photoshop assets imported as well.
*  Last but certainly not least, it will ask if you'd like to setup another project.

A very handy script for when a ton of production work comes your way.
